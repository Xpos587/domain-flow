# Review the consistency of the TDDoc and codebase

Read carefully MAIN_TDDoc_DOCUMENT.

Also you can read any of the following documents (if they exist):
   - `docs/5.3_technical_design_data_models_schemas.md` -when you need the detailes about component inteactions, data contracts and data schemas 
   - `docs/5.3_technical_design_api_endpoints.md` - when you need the API endpoints specification
   - `docs/5.3_technical_design_deployment.md` - when you need the deployment specification
CRUCIAL: Only read the documents when you need to get information about the relevant topic, dont read them if they are not relevant to the current work you are working on.

You have to find all inconsistencies in the TDDoc and fix them. You must ensure that TDDoc and codebase are coherent, correct and absolutely impeccable. It must contain no descrepancies, be free of any errors and have no any statements that would require any clarification before passing to the code implementation step.

Implement the tasks #ARGUMENTS of these (WARN! pay attention only to the Task #ARGUMENTS) :

## Task 1 - Components of the system

### Naming and IDs consistency
Look at each component in Section 2. Component Architecture one-by-one (use a checklist) and check if the IDs and names are used consistently throughout the whole TDDoc.

Take into account the following naming and ID rules:
Components codes:
```
F - Frontend (example: F1.UserProfile)
B - Backend  (example: B1.AuthService)
D - Data Layer 
E - External Services
```
### Consistency with codebase
After you make sure in the internal consistency within TDDoc, you have to look through the whole codebase and find any component names are not consistent with the TDDoc. Remove any descrepancy in code and comments with the TDDoc.

## Task 2 - Interactions and Data Contracts

### Naming and IDs consistency
Look at each interaction between components in Section 3. Data Models & Schemas one-by-one (use a checklist) and check if the IDs and names on the interaction and data contracts are used consistently throughout the whole TDDoc.

Interactions and Data Contracts codes:
```
I - Interaction (e.g., I1, I2, etc.)
DC - Data Contract, naming: DC<interaction_number>-<contract_number>.<name> - data contract <name> for interaction <interaction_number> and contract <contract_number> . Example: DC1-1.LoginRequest (data contract 1 for interaction 1)
```
### Consistency with codebase
After you make sure in the internal consistency within TDDoc, you have to look through the whole codebase and find any interaction and data contract names are not consistent with the TDDoc. Remove any descrepancy in code and comments with the TDDoc.

## Task 3 - API Endpoints consistency
Look at each internal API endpoint in Section 4. API Endpoints one-by-one (use a checklist) and check if the API endpoints are used consistently throughout the whole TDDoc. Make sure that data contracts referenced in the API endpoints are consistent with the section `3. Data Models & Schemas`.

After you make sure in the internal consistency within TDDoc, you have to look through the whole codebase and find any API endpoint that are not consistent with the TDDoc. Remove any descrepancy in code and comments with the TDDoc.

## Final Report 
After you have fixed all inconsistencies in the TDDoc, create a final report in the file `docs/reports/5.3_technical_design_lint_report.md` (append if exists) describe all the work you have done, list all the components, interactions, data contracts and API endpoints you checked, inconsistencies you have found and fixed.
