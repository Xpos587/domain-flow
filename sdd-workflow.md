# Methodology for the Building of Applications with AI Coding Agents

## Key Principles

The key approach is to use a hybrid of Waterfall and Agile methodologies to balance stability and flexibility.

### Waterfall Elements (Stability)

1. **Clear Foundation**: Core architecture and business model don't change frequently
2. **AI Context**: Consistent system design helps AI agents understand the codebase
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Major architectural decisions made with full information
4. **Quality Standards**: Established patterns for AI agents to follow

### Agile Elements (Flexibility)

1. **Feature-Level Iteration**: Each feature goes through its own design-build-test cycle
2. **Rapid Feedback**: Quick validation of assumptions with working software
3. **User-Centric**: Regular user input shapes feature development
4. **Adaptive**: Process improves based on what works with AI agents

### AI-Specific Adaptations

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Iterative improvement of AI instructions
2. **Context Management**: Maintaining consistent AI understanding across sprints
3. **Quality Validation**: Human oversight of AI-generated code
4. **Learning Integration**: Capturing and applying AI coding patterns

## Step 1: Discovery & Concept

### Step 1.1 Sketching Hypothesis

_This is an initial brainstorming session to identify a potential problem or opportunity and formulate an initial hypothesis about a potential solution and its value. Can be in the form of audio recording that is transcribed and then refined with LLMs to produce the Initial Hypothesis Document. It can also involve creating an optional low-fidelity prototype to visualize the concept._

**Activities:**

- **Identify a potential problem** or opportunity.
- **Formulate an initial hypothesis** about a potential solution and its value
- **Define a target audience** for the proposed solution.
- **Outline key assumptions** that need to be validated.
- **(Optional) Create a low-fidelity UI prototype** clickable with stubbed interactions to make the concept tangible.

**Deliverables:**

- **Initial Hypothesis Document**

  - _Format: A brief, 2-3 page document._
  - _Template: [templates/1.1_initial_hypothesis.md](templates/1.1_initial_hypothesis.md)_
  - _Prompt: [prompts/1.1_initial_hypothesis.md](prompts/1.1_initial_hypothesis.md)_

- **Open Questions List**

  - _Format: A list of questions that need to be answered to refine the hypothesis with stakeholders._

- **Low-Fidelity Prototype (optional)**
  - _Format: Clickable wireframes or a simple UI with stubbed data and interactions._
  - _Purpose: To demonstrate the core concept to stakeholders and product partners for early feedback._

**Optional:** on this stage a comprehensive concept can be already created. So, in 1.2 only Market Research is needed and then the Initial Hypothesis Document transformed to the Concept Document, ready to be passed to 1.5 CustDev step.

### Step 1.2 Initial Requirements Gathering (with stakeholders)

_Stakeholders are the people who are affected by the problem or opportunity and have a vested interest in the solution. Mostly the project team, product owners, and sometimes the customers._

**Activities:**

- **Stakeholder interviews (if available)** and user research. The optional prototype from Step 1.1 can be used to facilitate these discussions.

**Deliverables:**

- **Stakeholder Interview Notes (optional)**
  - _Format: Simple notes or transcripts_
  - _Content: Pain points, needs, expectations, constraints, etc._
- **Refined Initial Hypothesis Document**

### Step 1.3. Market Research

**Activities:**

- **Market research** - analyze the market and identify the target audience
- **Competitive analysis** - analyze the competition and identify the unique selling proposition
- **Success metrics definition** (KPIs, user adoption goals)

The report is completed by AI in Deep Research mode - multiple models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc) are used to generate the reports.

**Deliverables:**

  - _Length: 5-10 pages_

### Step 1.5 Early Customer Development - CustDev (optional)

_Use when you can identify and collaborate with users to validate concepts and gather deep insights. This can involve two distinct feedback groups: Product Partners and "fresh eyes" usability testers._

**Activities:**

- **Identify and recruit Product Partners**: Find deeply engaged users who feel the problem and can provide strategic feedback on the solution's value. Offer them some perks like a free usage of the product or service. Establish a feedback loop and communication channel with partners.
- **Conduct in-depth problem/solution interviews** with these partners. Present initial concepts to Product Partners for early validation. The optional prototype can be a key tool for this.
- **Refine the Initial Hypothesis Document** based on the feedback from the Product Partners.

**Deliverables:**

- **Product Partner List**
  - _Content: List of confirmed early adopters, their profiles, and engagement agreements._
- **Customer Interview Insights**

## Step 5: Design

_Notes_:

- all the artifacts in this Step 5 (Functional Design, Technical Design, UI Design) must be created on the firsts Phase and then updated by introduction of new phases
- in the implementation process these artifacts are updated and refined (with specs linter, TBD) - to make sure the actual implementation matches the design

### Step 5.1: Functional Design

**Activities:**

**Decision Point: To Prototype or Not?**

_Based on the initial functional design, assess complexity and uncertainty to choose the next step._

**When to Use Rapid Prototyping:**

_Always Prototype When:_

- Feature is complex or has unclear requirements
- Features in this phase can be implemented in a standalone app without deep integration with other features !!!
- User behavior is uncertain
- Technical feasibility is questionable
- Stakeholder alignment is needed

_Skip Prototyping When:_

- Feature is straightforward and well-understood
- It is hard to implement in a standalone app without deep integration with other features !!!
- Similar patterns exist in the codebase
- Time constraints are critical
- Requirements are crystal clear

**Choose Your Path:**

#### Option A: Refine Design & Proceed (No Prototyping)

Proceed to Step 5.2: Visual Design

#### Option B: Validate with a Rapid Prototype

**B.1. Build & Test the Prototype**

**Activities:**

- **AI-generated prototypes** (can be throwaway code)
- **Conduct validation sessions** with both **Product Partners** (to test value) and **recruited usability testers** (to test clarity).
- **Stakeholder validation** of core concepts
- **Technical feasibility** validation
- **Pivot or proceed** decision

**Tools**:

- v0.dev
- Lovable
- Bolt
- etc.

**Deliverables:**

- **Working Prototype**
- **User Testing & Partner Feedback Report (optional)**
  - \*Content: A consolidated report with two distinct sections:
    - **Partner Feedback:** Insights on core functionality, value proposition, and strategic fit.

### Step 5.2:Visual Design

_Use when high-fidelity, pixel-perfect visuals are required before development. For simpler UIs or internal tools, the wireframes from the functional design and a prototype (if available) may be sufficient._

**Activities:**

- **Apply branding**, color palette, and typography to the approved wireframes.
- **Create high-fidelity mockups** for key screens and components.
- **Define visual style guide** elements (e.g., button states, spacing, iconography).
